WooCommerce Subscribe All The Things is a mini-extension for [WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) that allows you to add subscription options to non-subscription product types, such as Simple and Variable products. The plugin has been tested with and can be used to add subscription options to [Product Bundles](http://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/), [Composite Products](http://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/) and [Mix and Match Products](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/).

# Features

Capture more residual revenue by offering existing products on a recurring basis. Subscribe All The Things allows you to add subscription options to:

* Any Simple or Variable product -- no need to introduce new SKUs or complicate inventory management.
* Grouped product types such as [Composite Products](https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/) and [Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/).
* The cart page -- give customers the option to purchase their entire cart on a recurring billing and shipping schedule.

To incentivize customers to subscribe, you can even assign a different/discounted product price to each subscription option:

</p>

Additionally, Subscribe All The Things makes it possible to **add products and entire carts to existing subscriptions**:

* Products without subscription options can be added to **any active subscription**.
* Products with subscription options can be added only to active subscriptions with a **matching billing schedule**.

# Guide

### Requirements

To use the plugin, you will need:

* WooCommerce Subscriptions 2.1 or newer.
* WooCommerce 3.0 or newer.
* A sense of adventure.

**Note:** While we do our best to add new features, squash bugs and keep the plugin updated, we currently **do not offer a dedicated, premium support channel** for Subscribe All The Things. If you decide to install it on a production site, please remember that general support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner and critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

### Installation

1. Go to **WordPress Admin &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New**.
2. Click **Upload Plugin** at the top.
3. **Choose File** and select the .zip file you downloaded in Step 1.
4. Click **Install Now** and **Activate** the plugin.

### Product Subscription Options

To add subscription options to a non-subscription product:

1. Navigate to **Product Data > Subscriptions**.
2. Click **Add Option** to add subscription options.
3. **Optional**: Check **Force Subscription** if the product must be available on a recurring basis only.
4. **Optional**: If applicable, define whether the product should default to a one-time or recurring purchase using the **Default to** option.
5. **Optional**: Enter a custom **Subscription prompt** -- this is the text displayed above the subscription options on the product page.

#### Subscription Discounts

You can optionally offer a discounted price that's unique to each subscription option. This is a great way to provide an incentive for customers to subscribe to a product.

To offer subscription discounts locate the **Price** option and select either **Inherit from product** or **Override product**:

* **Inherit from product** allows you to enter a discounted amount as a percentage (without the `%` symbol) -- for example, to offer a price discounted by 10%, enter `10`.
* **Override product** allows you to override the default **Regular Price** and **Sale Price** of the product.
